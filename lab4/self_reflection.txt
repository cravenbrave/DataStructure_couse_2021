All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: plusOne and minusOne method. More elegant and convenient, save much time. 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Spent a lot of time thinking how to print the array orderly. But had many edge cases without plusOne and minusOne methods.

Also, I have another private method: isEfficient to check the resizing timing.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Many edge cases. Resizing is not really well.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: Online student...

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: Write plusOne and minusOne private method.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Write plusOne and minusOne private method, with much less edge cases.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: Online students, no chance to see the staff solution.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: getRecursiveHelper function. This is my first time, I wrote a recursive method by myself in such quick and elegant way. 

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Not really.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A: Online student, no chance to talk with my partner.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: Single sentinel circle node. 

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Nope.

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: So sad being an online student 98
